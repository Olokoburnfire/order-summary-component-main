## My process
  - First, I structured the HTML file so get a well-structured content.
  - Then, i wrote the base-styles, which included 'font-family' and 'background-color'.
  - Next thing i did was to add style to to page using CSS
  - Lastly, I created a repositiry on github and publish the code on github.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

It was through this project i learnt Flexbox. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: #ffffff;
}
```

### Continued development

i'd love to have an in-depth knowledge on FLEXBOX, CSS GRID AND JAVASCRIPT.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - This helped me in understanding html and css and most importantly Flexbox. I really liked this website and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com) -. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
